# E.Y.ÆŽ Revamp Project

Online doc: https://eyemap.netlify.app/

The map source files are originally decompiled by MLUI, and I asked him for the permission to use them as the starting point of this project.

You can get MLUI's version of VMF files here: [dwordmap.tar.xz on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_uoMlTbQ-7gCq0GxFawScb7yJ5RONHas/view?usp=sharing)

Note that you may need to patch the first map file to get it open in the Hammer World Editor, see [dworld01_point.patch](patch/dworld01_point.patch) for details. If you don't know how to use the patch, you can simply open the map file in a text editor, go to those red marked lines and delete them.
